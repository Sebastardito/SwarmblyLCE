"""Verdicts for C1 and C2, exactly as fixed by PREREGISTRATION_C1_C2 (2026-10-05).

The rules live in code so that the decision cannot drift after the data are
seen. ``decide(results)`` takes the dict written by ``run_real`` and returns,
for each hypothesis, one of ``holds``, ``falsified``, ``inconclusive``,
``refused`` (the instrument cannot decide) or ``not_tested``, with the reason.

Changing a threshold here after the first confirmatory run is a protocol
deviation and must be declared in the pre-registration's amendments section.
